# TODO app

We need:

1. To add the css that we will need for the app.
2. Start adding interfaces! https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html
  1. We need an interface for a TODO item.
  2. We need an interface for every status and properties of every React object.
  3. We need an interface for state of the app. 
3. In addition to that, create a basic React component that will show an input in which you can type a new TODO item.
Place it in our main component.
4. Use the new css!
