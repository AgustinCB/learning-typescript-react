# Set up of a React project

Our first step into creating a TODO list is to set up a project to work with react and Typescript.

I want you to do this:

1. Create an empty node project.
2. Install all the depencies that are needed. This includes at least: `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router`, `tsc`, `webpack` and a test suite (choose your favourite!)
3. Create a new webpack configuration that compiles from a `src` folder into a `dist` folder and and puts together all the pieces.
4. Create a basic `index.html` file whose body includes only the boundled javascript, an and empty div that will contain everything.
5. Create a new `index.tsx` file that will just add a new render a new div with the message `TODO list` into the empty div of the html file.
